I am a Senior ML Engineer at Etsy, where I work on orchestration systems for online model inference.

Before Etsy, I worked at Centene Corporation where I was involved in creating and deploying scalable Machine Learning 
solutions to mitigate Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in the medical claims.

Prior to Centene, I worked at Intel and was involved in creating digital twin of lithography process that 
involved working in cross-functional domains such as image processing, and developing chemical and optical computational models.

As a doctoral student in the department of Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 
I worked on computational transport models in nano-pores and nano-channels that bridged the gap between 
particle based simulations with continuum formulations. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v7wZ9hsAAAAJ&hl=en).
